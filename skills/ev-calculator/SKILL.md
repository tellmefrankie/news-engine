# Expected Value Calculator (Free)

Calculate expected value for stock positions using scenario-based modeling. Combines options data, earnings history, and short interest to size positions with mathematical discipline.

## What it does

For each position, builds probability-weighted scenarios:
- **Bull case**: Catalyst-driven upside (earnings beat, sector rotation, short squeeze)
- **Base case**: Normal trading range continuation
- **Bear case**: Downside risks (earnings miss, macro shock, sector rotation out)

Weights scenarios by:
- Options sentiment (real calls vs puts, excluding lottery)
- Historical earnings surprise patterns
- Short interest level and squeeze potential
- Sector momentum

## Usage

```
Calculate expected value for my portfolio:
- RXRX: 500 shares @ $3.26, stop-loss $2.85
- KTOS: 200 shares @ $56.99, stop-loss $52.00
- TEM:  100 shares @ $48.46, stop-loss $49.75

Use 3 scenarios (bull/base/bear) with probabilities.
Include confidence level and data quality assessment.
```
